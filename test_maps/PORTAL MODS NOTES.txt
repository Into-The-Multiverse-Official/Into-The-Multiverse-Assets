There are several experimental mods meant for Blappeture Mesa and Into the Multiverse. And others just for fun.
Some of these come in different designs, most of them have bugs and others are half finished.
Have fun with experimenting with these abominations.


----
BB8
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BB8 is a remote operated bot that refrences Star Wars. Mind you, this was conceived just after the trailer was initially released.
Originally I wanted his head to track the players head movements, but that failed to work. instead the camera and blody flailed a lot
The movements and controls are limited due to UI having limited choices to work with. You have to crouch to turn off the robot.
Someone once mentioned that a text file can be imported to create custom binds, but i never could get that to work.
Portaling this will result in the root parent taking priority and the children cliping through the wall before teleporting.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------
Flying Bomber NPC
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was my first attempt at creating the automated Flying red bomb core. Originally i tried the actual bomb prop, but it always broke early.
I tried to make the bomber have sporadic idle animations by making them fly toward coordinates, but the results were not great.
One could however create paths similar to the railways that cores use, but that would be infinitely more complex that this.
Portaling this will result in the root parent taking priority and the children cliping through the wall before teleporting.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------
Glados Flyer
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My first flying NPC, just after the wheatley helicopter. This one does not actually fly but follows a pathway like the cores on railings.
I used a series of rotating parts to create the illusion of banking turns and stabalizers. The tricky part is timing everything.
The rocket turrets regretablly dont always cause damage, so a lot of scripted elements were put in place to simulate the explosions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------
Heli-Bomber
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The heli-bomber was my first attempt at remote controlled machinery. However the controls are of course limited thanks to the UI.
The stability of all these flying devices are pretty janky thanks to the phys_keepupright, but what else is to be done?
The really annoying part was when the camera goes white when you drive this sucker through a portal, resulting in the cam being inside a wall.
Portaling this will result in the root parent taking priority and the children cliping through the wall before teleporting.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------
Hover Board
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This one never got fully realized due to inconsistant results. Somewhere in the workshop someone published this from my far older maps.
The biggest issue is the device operates by using troll physics. You lift it, it lifts you. I used push and catapult fields instead.
Unfortunately the effects sometimes dont occur at all, or they launch you right into the ceiling at break neck speeds.
However the worst part is that the map this was used on had water in it. When you drop this thing in water, your game WILL CRASH.
I never found out which parts caused this. it might be the particles, which behave differently when submerged.
Portaling this will result in the root parent taking priority and the children cliping through the wall before teleporting.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------
Portable Portal Wall
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This tiny tile is a fold out wall that you can place portals onto. It never got implemented because once it moves, the portal collapses.
And it can easily be moved the instant you attempt to walk through a portal. Cheats can however be used to allow for moving portals.
But moving portals distort the affect gravity has on the player when jumping anywhere near the actual portal. I learned this in my older maps.
Portaling this will result in the root parent taking priority and the children cliping through the wall before teleporting.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------
Portivity Combo Gun
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my latest design of my ultimate tool. The version in the latest maps however is older than this particular mod that i made.
Before the effects would clip through walls, allowing you to pull objects beyond walls. This one regulates the effects using multiple parts.
The feilds that push and pull are now segmented and disable when beyond the devices line of sight, thus limiting its power to the users view.
I also put in electric arcs and particle effects for the gravity mode so you can see it actually pulling objects toward you.
I tried changing the main weapons pellet dispensor by using actual combine balls to change the explosive yeilds. It still has its issues though.
The combine balls will bounces around instead of attaching themselves to what you hit them with, and they now have a lifespan where they die.
The balls also have blunt force impact as well and will push things around when colliding with anything that uses game physics.
The file for this mod also includes the necessary tools for Rusty the turret, the flashlight, credits, fades, electrical damage, etc.

Seal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is just a big door i never used. It was supposed to be for a pump room, but that got scrapped
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------
Turret sentinal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was supposed to be a security bot, originally slated for part 7. It was removed because it didnt really fit the mold for that part.
Also it kinda was far too similar in general design to the Turret Monster, so it felt like the reveal would get downplayed a pinch.
The snake like body is supposed to portrude from the ceiling, much like the camera in part 3 and scan the user and kill intruders.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------
Turret Monster
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you played my original multiverse mappack before i overhauled everything, you might recognize this horrid robotic eldritch monstrosity.
its got 4 tentacle arms, 8 turret eyes, a laser mouth, and packs a huge punch. The original had all kinds of scripting to it for movement.
The one you see in the mods folder however never got to be used and is awaiting more development. It needs a lot of work before its perfect.
Into the Multiverse hints of the Monsters presence in Part 4, during the dark tube room. In part 5, the bloodied broken test chamber and vents.
In Part 6, the broken train full of "hazzardous materials." And in Part 7, The crashed train in the acid pit just between the massive gates.
Part 8 was originally intended to give you the first real glimpse of the Turret Monster, and Part 9 is when you actually fight the beast.

watercooler
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is literally just that. A watercooler. Perfect for taking a break in the office while chell murders karen from accounting in cold blood.
This little bit of brush work doesnt really do anything, its just aesthetic. I tried putting real water in it once. Game didnt like that.
