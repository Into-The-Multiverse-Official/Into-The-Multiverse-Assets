I wanted to finish the story for Part 8 and the rest of the narrative, but life has unfortunately dealt me with far more important matters.
And regretfully that leaves me no choice but to drop the story of Into the Multiverse. Also since i was away, i forgot how to use these programs.
I know there are still people interested in seeing the conclusion, so I shall leave behind the entirety of all my files for you all to use.
Hopefully someone out there is willing to continue the story themselves so that everyone can see to its conclusion.

To be clear there are intended narratives that I have thought up that I hope to see brought to the screen that answer pending questions.
Questions about the previous plot points in the story. I know I can't make you use these writings, you can even derail the story altogether.
But know that there is indeed an over-arcing story to be told here. A plot from which all previous parts rely on in sequence.

These Files will be accessible to all who dare try to unfold the rest of the narrative, to write their own ideas
or to flesh out the original ones.

There will be several Notepad files attached as well,
One for each map detailing the narratives, bugs, and revision ideas

Be sure to Read it all if you are truly seriously going to take on the adventure!

Good Luck and God Speed.
