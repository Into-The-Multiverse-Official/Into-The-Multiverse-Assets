# Into The Multiverse Official Repository
The official repository for the Into The Multiverse Portal 2 map series. The regular single-player series and the ported coop series will be located here. Other test maps and other assets relating to the Into The Multiverse series are uploaded.

***PLEASE READ!!!***
Instructions for working with Into The Multiverse maps:
1. Clone this repository; ensure the destination is in a folder with no files.
2. Read the ABSOLUTELY READ ME RIGHT NOW YOU MAD MAN.txt file. It's a message from Blappature, and I recommend you read it.
3. Move the repo to a new folder in the maps folder in the sdk_content folder of your Portal 2 install. The full path from your Portal 2 folder should be: Portal 2/sdk_content/maps/(repo here)
4. Git or GitHub Desktop will freak out that it can't find the repository, make sure to redirect it to the new place that you moved it to.
5. Two ways to use the Into The Multiverse Assets in Hammer

   a. (The organized way *Recommend*) Make a itmv in your Portal 2 folder, stick all the contents of the assets folder in the repository in the itmv folder. Add itmv to your gameinfo.txt in the portal2 folder.

   b. (The stick it in there and forgetta bout it way) Take the contents of the assets folder and stick it into the portal2 folder.

7. Test if the assets work by loading one of the original maps up in Hammer, don't save the map, keep the originals as original copies. If you accidentally save, you can discard the changes with git (or GitHub Desktop, whichever you use), then get a new original copy from the ITMV_Original_Files_ZIP.zip file.
8. Congrats! If everything appears correctly in Hammer, and when you load up a test map like mp_coop_itmvcoop_elements_testroom.vmf and see the func_instance in there is showing, then you've done everything correctly. Yippie!
