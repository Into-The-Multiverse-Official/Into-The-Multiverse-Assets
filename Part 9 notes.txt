INTO THE MULTIVERSE PART 9
-----------------------------


Part 9 was originally going to be part 8, but i decided i wanted to create a narrative that would tie in Rusty and Chell instead.
I had not been able to finish part 9 either due to not being able to come up with means of tieing together the various game elements.

You will notice that some of these elements are an attempt to replicate the chapter of Half Life where you prepare the Cascade Portal.
I also tried re-inventing the final portal by making it significantly bigger than normal, but there were several issues that arose.
I wanted to make a giant portal open to the wrong world and a huge monster come through, but i had problems with clipping models.
The hydro rooms also had issues due to not possesing enough testing and the enemies were too easy to defeat with the portivity gun.

I think it would be a good idea to create some kind of relay system that regulates health bars for the enemies so they dont die immediately.
